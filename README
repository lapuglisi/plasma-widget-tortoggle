Tor Controller plasmoid
----------------------

This is a fork of the original repository: https://github.com/plasma-extensions/plasma-widget-tortoggle
This repository aims at adding more functionalities to the widget, such as:
- Offer an option to define the service name of the tor instance (system)
- Add a button to launch the Tor Browser.
- Add UI improvements

-- Build instructions --

cd torcontroller (or where ever you cloned/decompressed the sources)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=MYPREFIX .. 
make 
make install

(MYPREFIX is where you install your Plasma setup, replace it accordingly - likely /usr)

Restart plasma to load the applet 
(in a terminal type: 
kquitapp plasmashell 
and then
plasmashell
and you should be able to find it in the applet browser)

or view it with 
plasmawindowed org.kde.torcontrol
