Tor Controller plasmoid
----------------------

This is a fork from the original repository: https://github.com/plasma-extensions/plasma-widget-tortoggle
I plan to add more functionalities to the Widget, such as:
1. Offer an option to define the Tor service to control.
2. Add a "Launch Tor Browser" button.
3. Add UI improvements.
4. Apply some bug fixes

-- Build instructions --

cd torcontroller (or where ever you cloned/decompressed the sources)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=MYPREFIX .. 
make 
make install

(MYPREFIX is where you install your Plasma setup, replace it accordingly - likely /usr)

Restart plasma to load the applet 
(in a terminal type: 
kquitapp plasmashell 
and then
plasmashell
and you should be able to find it in the applet browser)

or view it with 
plasmawindowed org.kde.torcontrol
